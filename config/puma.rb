# This configuration file will be evaluated by Puma. The top-level methods that
# are invoked here are part of Puma's configuration DSL. For more information
# about methods provided by the DSL, see https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html.

# Puma starts a configurable number of processes (workers) and each process
# serves each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
#
# The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# to prioritize throughput over latency.
#
# As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# response time (latency) of the application.
#
# The default is set to 3 threads as it's deemed a decent compromise between
# throughput and latency for the average Rails application.
#
# Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.
# Optimize threads based on environment and available CPU cores
# For production: use 5 threads per worker for better concurrency
# For development: use 3 threads to reduce resource usage
